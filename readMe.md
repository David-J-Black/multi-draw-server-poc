To run the server that all the clients connect to, run the startServer.sh script.

All the required imports are in the requirements.txt file. You can quickly install them with `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` (the `-r` flag means that pip3 will install from a fil)

If you use a python venv, you can keep all these installed packages contained in this folder, but for the sake of this project being a learning tool i'm not too concerned about that right now.

If you go the the `debug` tab in VS Code, you will see options to launch the server and client of this project.
